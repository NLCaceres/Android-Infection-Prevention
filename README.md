## For Better Infection Prevention and Hospital Documentation. Also on iOS
  Originally an idea of my father's stemming from many hospitals being fairly slow to adopt internet and computed tech despite all the
  advancements in medicine itself. With the rise of Big Data and with consideration to HIPA, keeping relevant statistics has been shown to
  improvement patient outcome, prevent hospital acquired infections, and improve healthcare practices. With those benefits in mind, I hoped
  to create an app that could meet the demands of a hospital or local clinic without making their lives more difficult upon adoption.
